                OFW Tulong considerably and practically understands the nature of work of manning agencies—both local and international—that are primarily engaged in the employment and deployment of land-based and sea-based Filipino migrant workers across the globe. Whether skilled, non-skilled, professional, or non-professional, these OFWs are at the heart of our mission.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                It is on this foundation that OFW Tulong makes itself readily available to extend a helping hand to OFWs and their families in need. The platform serves as a bridge to connect with the appropriate government offices and agencies, ensuring that every OFW’s rights, welfare, and interests are promoted, protected, and sustained through coordinated communication and dedicated action.
